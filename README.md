# OralCancer-MachineLearning
## Machine Learning Project

- Oral cancer is a type of cancer that affects the mouth, including the lips, tongue, and surrounding tissues. Early detection of oral cancer can be difficult because it often does not have visible symptoms in the early stages. However, once the cancer progresses, it can cause significant morbidity and mortality.
